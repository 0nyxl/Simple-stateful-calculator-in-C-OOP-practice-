# Stateful C++ Calculator (OOP Practice)

A robust, object-oriented calculator implemented in C++. This project demonstrates fundamental OOP concepts such as **encapsulation**, **private data members**, and **state tracking**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Stateful Operations:** Remembers the previous result and the last operation performed.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents division by zero with user-friendly warnings.
- **Undo Functionality:** Ability to revert the last operation and restore the previous state.
- **Clean Interface:** Easy-to-read result summaries printed directly to the console.

## 🛠️ Concepts Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation:** Using private members (`_Result`, `_LastResult`) and public methods.
- **Const Correctness:** Ensuring read-only methods don't modify the object state.
- **Logic Handling:** Managing internal flags to track the calculator's status.
